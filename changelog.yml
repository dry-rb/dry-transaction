- version: 0.13.1
  date: '2021-01-31'
  changed:
  - 'Resolve Ruby 2.7 deprecation warnings and support Ruby 3.0 (@robbl-as in PR #134)'
- version: 0.13.0
  date: '2018-06-13'
  changed:
  - Internal step operations (steps backed by instance methods) can now be replaced
    via constructor arguments. Using instance methods to wrap external step operations
    now only works if the step is defined using the `with:` option (timriley in [#109][pr109])
- version: 0.12.1
  date: '2018-06-05'
  fixed:
  - Support result matching on step failures nested within around steps (flash-gordon
    in [#106][pr106])
- version: 0.12.0
  date: '2018-05-16'
  changed:
  - Switch to `Dry::Monads::Result` API (away from `Either` API deprecated in dry-monads
    1.0 betas) (Morozzzko in [#104][pr104])
- version: 0.11.2
  date: '2018-05-15'
  changed:
  - Use `Dry::Monads::Result` instead of the deprecated `Dry::Monads::Either` in the
    `check` step adapter (PavelTkachenko in [#103][pr103])
- version: 0.11.1
  date: '2018-03-15'
  added:
  - Include `operation_name:` in options passed to step adapters. This is helpful
    for 3rd party step adapters that need the operation's name to fetch it from the
    container again later. (timriley in [#94][pr94])
- version: 0.11.0
  date: '2018-02-19'
  added:
  - 'Around steps, which allow control of the execution of subsequently called steps.
    If you know how middleware works in rack or how around callbacks can be used in
    RSpec, it''s the same. A typical example of usage would be for DB transactions
    (now first class support!) or controlling side effects: rolling back the changes,
    cleaning garbage produced by a failed transaction, etc. See a more detailed explanation
    of how this works [in the PR][pr85] (flash-gordon in [#85][pr85])'
  - Broadcast when a step has started by sending the event `step_called` (mihairadulescu
    in [#82][pr82])
  - Add new step `check` that returns `Success` or `Failure` base on conditions (semenovDL
    in [#84][pr84])
  - Support for transaction steps without input values (GustavoCaso and timriley in
    [#69][pr69])
  changed:
  - "[BREAKING] Steps no longer broadcast events with their step name followed by
    `_success` or `_failure`. Now, more generic names are used for the broadcast events.
    Before each step runs, a `step` event is broadcast, with the step name and its
    arguments. After a step runs, a `step_succeeded` or `step_failed` event is broadcast,
    also with the step name, the arguments and the return value (GustavoCaso in [#83][pr83])"
  - "[BREAKING] Pub/sub support is now handled using [dry-events][dry-events] instead
    of wisper. Subscriber objects should now respond to `#on_step`, `#on_step_succeeded`,
    or `#on_step_failed` to receive broadcast events (GustavoCaso in [#90][pr90])"
  - "[BREAKING] The step adapter API has been changed in order to support around steps,
    although, the changes are not significant. Previously, an adapter received a `step`
    and a list of arguments for calling the operation. The list was passed as `*args`
    then you were needed to call `call_operation` on `step` and provide the list.
    From now on an adapter gets an `operation`, its `options`, and `args` (_without_
    `*`). `operation` is an ordinary callable object so a typical call is as simple
    as `operation.(*args)`, that's it. If you want to turn your adapter into an around-like
    one you need to add `&block` parameter to the list of `call` arguments (e.g. `def
    call(operation, options, args, &block)`). `block` is responsible for calling the
    subsequent steps thus you can check or transform the return value and make some
    decisions based on it. Note capturing the block in the list of arguments is mandatory,
    a simple `yield` won't work, there are reasons, believe us. Check out the sources
    of [`around.rb`](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/blob/master/lib/dry/transaction/step_adapters/around.rb)
    for reference, it's dead simple (flash-gordon in [#85][pr85])"
  - Usages of the `Either` monad was updated with `Result` and its constructors. See
    [the changes](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-monads/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v040-2017-11-11)
    in `dry-monads` for more details (flash-gordon in [#81][pr81])
  - Minimal Ruby version is 2.2 (flash-gordon in [#72][pr72])
  fixed:
  - Pass arguments to a step with keyword arguments with default values (flash-gordon
    in [#74][pr74])
  - Steps can be wrapped with private methods (semenovDL in [#70][pr70])
  - Improved error message on missing transaction step (Morozzzko in [#79][pr79])
- version: 0.10.2
  date: '2017-07-10'
  fixed:
  - Only resolve an operation object from the container if the container reports that
    the key is present. This prevents exceptions from being raised when using dry-container
    and defining a transaction that includes steps both container-based and local
    method steps (jonolsson in [#64][pr64])
- version: 0.10.1
  date: '2017-06-30'
  fixed:
  - Preserve step notification listeners when calling a transaction after passing
    extra step arguments (jcmfernandes in [#65](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/65))
- version: 0.10.0
  date: '2017-06-15'
  summary: 'This release makes major changes to the dry-transaction API: transactions
    are now defined within your own class, support instance methods for defining or
    wrapping steps, and operation containers are now optional.'
  added:
  - |-
    Added `Dry::Transaction::Operation` convenience mixin. This gives easy access to `Right` and `Left` result builders within your operation objects, and also enables dry-matcher's block-based result matching API for when the operations are called individually. (timriley in [#58](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/58))

        ```ruby
        class MyOperation
          include Dry::Transaction::Operation

          def call(input)
            Right(input)
          end
        end

        my_op = MyOperation.new
        my_op.("hello") do |m|
          m.success do |v|
            "Success: #{v}
          end
          m.failure do |v|
            "Failure: #{v}"
          end
        end
        # => "Success: hello"

  - |-
    [BREAKING] Transactions are now defined within your own classes using a mixin & class-level API for step definitions (GustavoCaso & timriley in [#58](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/58))

        ```ruby
        class CreateUser
          include Dry::Transaction(container: Container)

          step :process, with: "operations.process"
          step :validate, with: "operations.validate"
          step :persist, with: "operations.persist"
        end

        create_user = CreateUser.new
        create_user.call("name" => "Jane Doe")
        ```

      Instance methods can wrap operations by calling `super`:

        ```ruby
        class CreateUser
          include Dry::Transaction(container: Container)

          step :process, with: "operations.process"
          step :validate, with: "operations.validate"
          step :persist, with: "operations.persist"

          def process(input)
            adjusted_input = do_something_with(input)
            super(adjusted_input)
          end
        end
        ```

      Substitute operations can be injected when initializing objects (helpful for testing):

        ```ruby
        create_user = CreateUser.new(process: substitute_process_operation)
        ```
  - |-
    Transactions can be defined without an operations container, using instance methods only.

        ```ruby
        class CreateUser
          include Dry::Transaction

          step :process
          step :validate

          def process(input)
            input = do_something_with(input)
            Right(input)
          end

          def validate(input)
            if input[:email].include?("@")
              Right(input)
            else
              Left(:not_valid)
            end
          end
        end
        ```
  - "[BREAKING] You can no longer extend existing transactions with `#prepend`, `#append`,
    `#insert`, or `#remove`. Since transactions will now be instances of your own
    classes, with their own different behaviors, there’s no predictable way to combine
    the behaviors of two different classes. If you need the ability to add or remove
    steps, you can create separate transactions for the different behaviours you need
    to offer, or build into your own transaction class a way to skip steps based on
    input or step arguments."
  - "[BREAKING] Blocks in step definitions are no longer accepted. If you want to
    wrap a step with some local behavior, wrap it with an instance method (see above)."
  - "[BREAKING] There is no longer an option for configuring the result matcher block
    API - we now use `Dry::Transaction::ResultMatcher` by default. If you want to
    provide your own matcher, you can do this by overriding `#call` in your transaction
    classes and using your own matcher when a block is given."
- version: 0.9.0
  date: '2016-12-19'
  added:
  - |-
    Procs (or any callable objects) can be passed as a step's `with:` option instead of a container identifier string (AMHOL in [#44](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/44))

        ```ruby
        Dry.Transaction(container: MyContainer) do
          step :some_step, with: "operations.some_thing"
          step :another, with: -> input {
            # your code here
          }
        end
        ```
  - |-
    Support for passing blocks to step adapters (am-kantox in [#36](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/36))

        ```ruby
        Dry.Transaction(container: MyContainer) do
          my_custom_step :some_step do
            # this code is captured as a block and passed to the step adapter
          end
        end
        ```
  changed:
  - Whole step object is passed to `StepFailure` upon failure, which provides more
    information to custom matchers (mrbongiolo in [#35](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/35))
  - "`#call` argument order for step operations is now `#call(input, *args)`, not
    `#call(*args, input)` (timriley in [#48](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/48))"
  - "`Dry::Transaction::Sequence` renamed to `Dry::Transaction` (timriley in [#49](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction/pull/49))"
- version: 0.8.0
  date: '2016-07-06'
  changed:
  - Match block API is now provided by `dry-matcher` gem (timriley)
  - 'Matching behaviour is clearer: match cases are run in order, the first match
    case “wins” and is executed, and all subsequent cases are ignored. This ensures
    a single, deterministic return value from the match block - the output of the
    single “winning” match case. (timriley)'
  added:
  - Provide your own matcher object via a `matcher:` option passed to `Dry.Transaction`
    (timriley)
- version: 0.7.0
  date: '2016-06-06'
  added:
  - "`try` steps support a `:raise` option, so a caught exception can be re-raised
    as a different (more domain-specific) exception (mrbongiolo)"
  changed:
  - Use dry-monads (e.g. `Dry::Monads::Either::Right`) instead of kleisli (`Kleisli::Either::Right`)
    (flash-gordon)
  fixed:
  - Add `#respond_to_missing?` to `StepFailure` wrapper class so it can more faithfully
    represent the failure object it wraps (flash-gordon)
  - Stop the DSL processing from conflicting with ActiveSupport's `Object#try` monkey-patch
    (joevandyk)
- version: 0.6.0
  date: '2016-04-06'
  added:
  - Allow custom step adapters to be supplied via a container of adapters being passed
    as a `step_adapters:` option to `Dry.Transaction` (timriley)
  - Raise a meaningful error if a `step` step returns a non-`Either` object (davidpelaez)
  - "## Internal"
  - Change the step adapter API so more step-related information remains available
    at the time of the step being called (timriley)
