  # Build a module to make your class a business transaction.
  #
  # A business transaction is a series of callable operation objects that
  # receive input and produce an output.
  #
  # The operations can be instance methods, or objects addressable via `#[]` in
  # a container object that you pass when mixing in this module. The operations
  # must respond to `#call(input, *args)`.
  #
  # Each operation will be called in the order it was specified in your
  # transaction, with its output passed as the input to the next operation.
  # Operations will only be called if the previous step was a success.
  #
  # A step is successful when it returns a [dry-monads](dry-monads) `Success`
  # object wrapping its output value. A step is a failure when it returns a
  # `Failure` object.  If your operations already return a `Success` or `Failure`, they
  # can be added to your operation as plain `step` steps.
  #
  # Add operation to your transaction with the `step` method.
  #
  # If your operations don't already return `Success` or `Failure`, then they can be
  # added to the transaction with the following steps:
  #
  # * `map` --- wrap the output of the operation in a `Success`
  # * `try` --- wrap the output of the operation in a `Success`, unless a certain
  #   exception is raised, which will be caught and returned as a `Failure`.
  # * `tee` --- ignore the output of the operation and pass through its original
  #   input as a `Success`.

  #       result = do_something_with(input)
  #       Success(result)
  #     end
  #   end
